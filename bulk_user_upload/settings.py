"""
Settings for bulk-user-upload are all namespaced in the BULK_USER_UPLOAD setting.
For example your project's `settings.py` file might look like this:
BULK_USER_UPLOAD = {
    'ACCOUNT_CREATION_EMAIL_SUBJECT': 'Account Created',
    'LOGIN_URL': '/login/',
}
This module provides the `settings` object, that is used to access
bulk-user-upload settings, checking for user settings first, then falling
back to the defaults.
